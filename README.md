# Michael LoCascio
I'm a software engineer with experience using JavaScript, React.js, HTML, and CSS, with some recent dabbling in backend work with Node, Express, and MongoDB. While my background is in higher education, political science, and longform writing, I'm excited to use what I've learned about web design and self-documenting code as well as my knack for picking up new languages, libraries, and frameworks to hit the ground running as a full-time software engineer. 

I'm open to Frontend and Full-stack software engineering opportunities anywhere in the US.

## Current Status
üë©‚Äçüíª I'm working on Spiral-Mountain, my first crack at a fully deployed fullstack web application, centered around my biggest pastime: gaming. I'm learning a lot by pushing through problems I've encountered on the backend, and I'm looking forward to putting some elbow grease into the frontend when everything is running smoothly.

üß† I'm currently learning about techniques for maximizing page load speed, with caching being my current area of interest. On the side, I'm refreshing on core Javascript fundamentals while practicing data structure and algorithm problems on Leetcode.

‚è≠ In the not-so-distant future, I'm looking forward to using what I've learned to do contract work for local businesses, redesigning and rebuilding websites from the ground up with accessibility and mobile-first layouts in mind. My ultimate goal is to position myself as a great candidate for a fulltime software engineering position at a company that values employee development, encourages mentorship, and might need some work on documentation, to which I'd love to contribute!

## üöÄ More About Me
I have a few hobbies/interests that take up the bulk of my free time:

1. Gaming is my biggest hobby: I grew up with a Nintendo 64 and the original Playstation. My childhood was defined by the likes of Banjo-Kazooie, Jak & Daxter, The Legend of Zelda, and later the Battlefield and Call of Duty franchises. Today, my taste in games is broad-- I still have love for first-person-shooters and platformers, but I'm interested in spending more time with turn-based strategy games like Civilization and the Fire Emblem series.

2. Piano: I started to learn how to play when I was about 4 years old. As a kid, I would often fall asleep to the sound of my dad getting piano lessons, which I at least partially attribute to my ear for music, and ability to learn and play music by ear rather than by reading sheet music. This is a solo hobby I use to de-stress during breaks or on the weekends.

3. Gym: My dad was a bodybuilder back in his college days, and has kept in good shape ever since, so I've always had a good influence when it came to physical fitness. I fell in love with going to the gym during my high-school football years, and it's been a tremendous benefit to my mental health and overall quality of life. More recently, I reconnected with an old friend who's now become my traning buddy: we go to the gym 3-4 times a week, pushing eachother to lift improve our strength. He's also a product manager at a tech startup, so he's been a wellspring of good advice and support outside of the gym as well!

4. Skiing: Dad started out as a ski instructor for the United States Adaptive Recreation Center (USARC) some time in the early 90's, and has been going up every winter season ever since to help people with disabilities have the time of their lives. Since I was about 8, he taught me how to ski, so I'm not too shabby up there these days! It's a seasonal activity for the most part, but something I look forward to doing more of in the future, maybe even helping out with USARC some day.

5. Hiking: Especially with all the time I spend staring at a computer, I like to spend some good quality time outdoors. Always down to find a new waterfall to appreciate or strange aquatic creature to stare at in tide pools.
